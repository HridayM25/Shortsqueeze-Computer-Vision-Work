# Shortsqueeze-Computer-Vision-Work
Work done during the Shortsqueeze internship that I had undertaken from November 2022 to February 2023. 

The application basically was a Clothes Recommender System. 

The worklow was: 
1) Use Yolov5 to detect the clothes worn, accuracy should be high for the detection of the class, as well as the placement of the bounding boxes. Most existing datasets related to clothes are labelled on Western Clothes,
  and we required the same extending to traditional and casual Indian wear. Hence, I collected the data, from various sources, and manually annotated the data. The dataset is provdided here:
